# angular_chat

A chat app made with angular frontend and node.js backend with socket.io for message handling.
Users can send messages which are viewable on the main page across multiple browsers.
The messages are inserted into the page html and because there is no database involved they disappear on page refresh.

# Installation

Just clone the repo into a folder, start the node.js server with "node server.js" in one console, and start the angular frontend with "ng serve" in another console.
Then navigate to localhost:4000 to find the webpage.
