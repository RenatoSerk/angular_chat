# angular_chat

A chat app made with angular frontend and node.js backend with socket.io for message handling.
Users can send messages which are viewable on the main page across multiple browsers.
The messages are inserted into the page html and because there is no database involved they disappear on page refresh.

# Installation

Clone the repo into the desired directory.  
Run 'npm install' in console  
Run 'node server.js' in console  
Run 'ng build' in a second console  
  
If local, navigate to localhost:3000, and open multiple browsers to see the action!
